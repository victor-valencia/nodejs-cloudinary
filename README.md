# [Node.js + Cloudinary](https://github.com/victor-valencia/nodejs-cloudinary) on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

### Deploy

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

> I am available to work with individuals or companies who are looking to build their blazingly super-fast publishing platform. [Contact-Me](https://www.victorvr.com)

If the above button does not work for you, disable anything that might be blocking Heroku from inferring the referrer (e.g. Brave shield), or try this: https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/victor-valencia/nodejs-cloudinary (if you're using a fork, make sure to point the template link to your repo).

**NOTE**: we do _not_ support deploying by downloading the source file or by copying over a cloned folder. Downloading/copying folders tends to break symlinks, so we recommend that you deploy by clicking the button in this repository or your fork on GitHub.

### Things you should know

After deployment,

- The app may take a few minutes to come to life
- If you subsequently set up a [custom domain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains)

### Configuring environment variables

This app is configured with environment variables. You can change it later in Config Vars.

- `HOST`: **Required**. Hostname of your server (By default '::' for deploy in Heroku)

Once your app is up and running with these variables in place, you should be able to upload and delete images.

### Change Config Vars Value in Heroku
How can I change the value of `HOST`?. You can change the values using the `Heroku CLI` or `Heroku Dashboard`.
